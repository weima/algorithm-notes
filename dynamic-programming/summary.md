# Dynamic Programming
   * Dynamic Programming is similar to Divide and Concuer, both try to solve original problem by combine sub problems
   * Dynamic Programming divide problems into **Overlapping** problems while Divide and Concuer divide problems into **Non-Overlapping** 
     problems
   * By saving solutions of already solved sub-problems, Dynamic Programming saves computation time in expense of Memory usage.
   * Dynamic Programming is often used to solve optimization problems. Problems in this category usually have many solutions. So, the solution we find would be **An Optimal Solution** instead of **The Optimal Solution**
   
## Steps of Dynamic Programming
1. Define a Structural Characteristics for Optimal Solution;
2. Recursively define value for Optimal Solution;
3. Calculate value of Optimal Solution, usually using bottom-up approach;
4. Using calculated value to constructure an Optimal Solution.
