This repository contains notes about my understanding of Algorithms

### The .md files contain English description of a data structure.

### The .pseudo files containing pseudo code written in python-link syntax.
 * Types are defined with **type** keyword
 * Routines are defined with **function** keyword
   * Every function contains the following description:
   1. Params: The input parameters for this function
   1. Precondition: Preconditions that need to be met, otherwise the behavior of this function is undefined
   1. Postcondition: Contex variables after the function been invoked  
   1. Return: The value being returned by this function
   
   A special value **None** is used to describe empty set
   
 * Block comments are contained in python doc region 
    ```python
      """
        This is a sample comments
      """
    ```
